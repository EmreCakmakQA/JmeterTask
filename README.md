# JmeterTask

This repo contains a collection of .jmx and .csv files which were created while working through Jmeter tasks. These tasks included working with the PokeAPI as well as the Studio Ghibli API.


# CRUD Functionality Testing For Todo List App (2nd Project)
The Todo list app has been tested with the following tests: Load, Spike, Stress, and Soak using Jmeter. 300 users were simulated for each test with an Apdex score of 1.00 and 0% error rate. You can find these in the jmx folder labelled as "todo_list.jmx". The corresponding HTML report and reports.csv are in the "HTML_Reports" and "Reports" folders respectively.
